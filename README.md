Hi people!!

I'm Marcelo, a.k.a. Marcelo Silva and I'm a javascript developer focused on Web technologies.

I love learn things, TV series, movies, NBA, NFL and our loved soccer in Brasil!!!

To be a better fullstack dev I focus on things bellow:

> Javascript and Typescript using Node, React, React Native, Angular

> CSS: only css, I'm a frameworkless dev

> Best practices using Relational Databases, clean code and a clean archictecture.

That's it!!
