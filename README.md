Hi people!! 

I'm Marcelo, a.k.a. Marcelo Silva and I'm a javascript developer focused on Web technologies.

I love learn things, TV series, movies, NBA, NFL and our loved soccer in Brasil!!!

To be a better fullstack dev I focus on things bellow:

1-Javascript and Typescript: Node, React, React Native, Angular and Cypress - every day
2-CSS: only css, I'm a frameworkless dev - every week
3-Design: Design concepts, Figma and Adobe XD - every week
4-Python, Django and Flask and your incredible bateries - every week
5-C# - Nowadays this is my work language

Best practices using Relational Databases, clean code and a clean archictecture.

That's it!!
